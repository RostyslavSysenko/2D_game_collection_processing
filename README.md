# 2D_game_collection_processing
Games were written in visual Java (processing) with the purpose to improve my programming skills and understand game development.

Some of the games include:

- Basketball game: on the left side of the screen, press on the screen and imagine you are pulling the string of the bow. The longer you stretch the ball while holding the mouse pressed, the further the ball will fly. By stretching the ball, you choose the direction and velocity of the ball. Try to get it into the hoop.

- Tennis: press ’s’ and the ball will appear, the ball bounces, but don’t let it pass the guard at the bottom. If it hits the bottom wall, you lose a point. The further you go into the game, the harder it gets.

- Stacker game: press space and it places a stack. A new one appears to its right. You have to stack them directly on top of each other, if not, then you lose some width and eventually lose the game

- Snake: use arrow keys and eat food. Don’t hit the wall

- Labyrinth: draw a labyrinth on the grid by pressing mouse on the squares. For the program to work the labyrinth has to be made of white cells of 1 block surrounded by 2 walls from each side. Once the labyrinth is drowned, press enter, choose the starting point and enter again and now choose an endpoint. Now press enter and the program will trace along the labyrinth. I know its pointless, but cool. The eventual goal with this mini-game is to integrate it with breadth-first search or depth first search so it can find the end point in circumstances when there are multiple directions avaiable for the next move.
